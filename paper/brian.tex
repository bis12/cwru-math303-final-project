\section{Computing Mersenne Primes In The Modern Era}
\subsection{Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search}
%TODO: Add references to this section
This collaborative project has been slowly but surely generating many of the worlds largest known primes over the last 10+ years.  In March of 2011, the largest prime known was found to be M$_{43,112,609}$. The test that this project uses to test primality is called the Lucas-Lehmer test (LLT) and some other tests to rapidly eliminate composite numbers.
\subsection{Lucas-Lehmer Test}
%TODO: this should probably be broken out into its own section ALSO REWRITE ALL OF THE THINGS! also add accent to  edouard Lucas name
The algorithm to implement the test is rather simple to understand.  The efficiency of the algorithm is not very good, but the problem is very hard, and so not much can be expected of it.  The test was created by  Edouard Lucas and Derrick Lehmer in the early part of the twentieth century.  The test works by... \textbf{This will be filled in next!}
\section{Mersenne Primes And The Future}
In this section we will discuss how Mersenne primes can be applied to other problems.
