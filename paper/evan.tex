\section{Background}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Prime numbers are one of the most important, interesting, and ultimately frustrating subjects in number theory. These integers that have no factors other themselves and 1 are seemingly randomly distributed along the number line and defy all efforts to untangle their mystery. One of the challenges associated with primes, as with any number that has no simple generating function is to find very large ones.  Today, the largest known primes are all Mersenne Primes.  On September 15, 2008 the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search announced that they had found the largest known prime $2^{43,112,609}-1$, a number that is over 12,000,000 digits long \cite{gimps}.  Mersenne Primes are primes of the form $2^p - 1$ where $p$ is a prime.  These numbers also have quite a few interesting properties that have made them a popular area to work in. There is no sign that Mersenne Primes will lose their dominance of the search for ever larger primes any time soon.  The study of these numbers began some 400 years ago with a French monk named Marin Mersenne.

Sautoy's \textit{The Music of The Primes} \cite{sautoy} tells the story of how Mersenne first began to think about primes. \textbf{tell story from page 39 here} The Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography\cite{scibio} lists natural philosophy, acoustics, music, mechanics, optics, and scientific communication as areas that Mersenne made contributions to.  It is clear by this that he was one of the more prolific thinkers of his time period, if not in all of history.  

%Marin Mersenne was born on September 8, 1588 near Oize, Sarthe, France. He maintained
%strong interests in the sciences, philosophy, music, and religion throughout the course of his
%life. At the age of 23, he joined the Roman Catholic Church and later became a friar within
%the French Order of the Minims. During a period in which scientific ideas were repressed by
%the Church, Mersenne played a crucial role in the diffusion of mathematical and scientific
%information throughout Western Europe. He met frequently in Paris with his academic circle
%to share the latest theories and discoveries, and to maintain discourse with the likes of Galileo,
%Christiaan Huygens, Pierre de Fermat, and more. In 1644, Mersenne published his most famous
%work, Cogita Physico-Mathematica, in which he proposed a formula for generating prime
%numbers. These prime numbers became known as Mersenne Primes.

\subsection{What is a Mersenne Prime?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A Mersenne number is a power of two less one, of the form
\begin{align}
M_p = 2^p - 1
\end{align}
The integer p must itself be a prime number in order to generate a Mersenne prime. If p is a
composite number, a composite number will be generated. This can be shown by...

\subsection{The Mersenne Conjecture}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The first of three Mersenne Conjectures appeared in Mersenne’s 1644 publication of Cogita
Physico-Mathematica, in which Mersenne postulated that primes are generated for p = 2, 3, 5,
7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127, and 257. As it turns out, Mersenne missed three primes for which his
formula generates a prime, namely 61, 89, and 107. He also missed the fact that the primes 67
and 257 do not generate primes.

The second Mersenne Conjecture was proposed 1989 by P. T. Bateman, J. L. Selfridge and
Wagstaff, Jr., S. S. in the article “The New Mersenne Conjecture.” This conjecture states that if
two of the three following conditions are true, then the third must also hold true~\cite{utm.edu-newconjecture}

\begin{enumerate}
\item $p = 2^k \pm 1$ or $p = 4k \pm 3$ (where $k$ is a natural number)
\item $2^p – 1$ is a prime (more specifically, a Mersenne Prime)
\item $(2^p – 1)/3$ is a prime
\end{enumerate}

As it stands, the New Mersenne Prime Conjecture has yet to be disproven.

The third and most recent Mersenne Conjecture is the Lenstra–Pomerance–Wagstaff
Conjecture. They propose that there are infinitely many primes, and that the number of
Mersenne Primes less than a number x may be approximated by the following formula~\cite{utm.edu-heuristic}

\begin{align}
e^{\gamma} \times \log \left( \dfrac{\log{x}}{\log{2}} \right)
\end{align}

Where the exponential of $\gamma$, called the Euler-Mascheroni constant, is approximately
1.78107.
