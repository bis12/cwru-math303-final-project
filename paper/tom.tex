\section{Properties Of Mersenne Numbers}

Mersenne Primes have a few properties that make them especially interesting. These are two of the most interesting that we've identified for the rough draft, however there are several additional properties that we might investigate if time and space permit.

\subsection{If $2^p$ is prime, then $p$ is prime}
If $2^p$ is a prime, then so too will be $p$~\cite{LighNeal}. 
This is a useful property to quickly determine that certain Mersenne Numbers are not Mersenne Primes (namely those with composite $p$). 
We will provide the short proof of this in the paper, as well as a bit more about the
implications of this in terms of Mersenne-prime searching.

\subsection{Mersenne Primes and Even Perfect Numbers}
Mersenne numbers have a one-to-one correspondence to even perfect numbers~\cite{utm.edu}. This is very interesting. Perhaps we will try a proof of this, but we will definitely explain how to calculate Mersenne Prime $\to$ Even perfect number and vice versa.
