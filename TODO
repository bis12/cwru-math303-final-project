./brian.tex:6:%TODO: ...fact that two Mersenne Primes were found the first day of using computers. ~\cite{Robinson54}
./brian.tex:10:First we will note that GIMPS is a distributed computing project.  There is a master server that organizes all of the clients that volunteers run on their own personal computers.  Each of these clients accomplishes a task that is appropriate for their processing power.  %TODO: finish this line of thought and then go into process from THE MATH page  of gimps site
./brian.tex:16:The Lucas-Lehmer Test (LLT) is arguably the reason that we use Mersenne Numbers as our candidates for very large prime are Mersenne Primes.  It makes %TODO: continue this description. I just want to show math and examples now...

./brian.tex:31:%TODO: THAT LAST LINE SUCKS PRETTY BAD, FIX IT
./evan.tex:10:%TODO: THIS IS DEFINED HERE AND IN SECTION 1.2 THIS IS A PROBLEM! FIX IT!
./evan.tex:19:%TODO: The last paragraph is nice content wise, but needs to flow better. In fact, the whole paper is like that...
